Code:

iexplore "hcp://CN=Microsoft%20Corporation,L=Redmond,S=Washington,C=US/Remote%20Assistance/Escalation/Unsolicited/UnSolicitedRCUI.htm"

you CAN leave out the iexplore part but it seemed to work better via iexplore.


NOW the Fun Part

TO Enable the reception of the "OFFER" remote assistance option.
= RUN GPEDIT.MSC from run command line ON THE PC TO RECEIVE HELP. 
Browse to 
Local Computer Policy/Computer Configuration/Administrative templates/System/Remote Assistance
then "ENABLE" the option "Offer remote Assistance"

You can set Remote Helps to something like DOMAIN\Domain Admins 
to be safe

now you can pop up the assistance request remotely on their pc.



To make it UNattended :)

I used the following as a Custom Asset Action using Lansweeper version 5.0 - 

c:\windows\system32\msra.exe /offerRA {smartname}

It will launch Remote Assistance using the selected computer name.

This action can be used to view all open and locked files on a remote computer.

The tool can be downloaded from the Microsoft website:
http://technet.microsoft...sinternals/bb897552.aspx

Copy "psfile.exe" to your action folder.

Action:
cmd.exe /K {actionpath}psfile.exe \\{smartname}
