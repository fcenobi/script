# respectively, the local and a specified remote host which must have ssh
# enabled, etc. The compare command extracts a list of devices and sharing
# state from the two profiles and generates lists of shared and non-shared
# devices on the two hosts plus a set of esxcli commands to reset clusterwide
# sharing to match the observed sharing between the hosts. The configure
# command sets devices to be shared clusterwide or not shared clusterwide on
# the local host and user can edit the command file before running this command.
